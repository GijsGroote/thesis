todo: this abstract


\todo[inline]{Create abstract when main content + results are finished}
BTW: summerised feedback from Martijn + Corrado:
abstract should be a stand alone text, a mini version with a small intro (clarify 'gap' in current research), explain where the proposed method is based upon and how it fills the 'gap', discuss results which mostly is compare with existing literure, how is the proposed method comparing?
