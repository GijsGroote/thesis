  abstract = {Affordances are key attributes of what must be perceived by an autonomous robotic agent in order to effectively interact with novel objects. Historically, the concept derives from the literature in psychology and cognitive science, where affordances are discussed in a way that makes it hard for the definition to be directly transferred to computational specifications useful for robots. This review article is focused specifically on robotics, so we discuss the related literature from this perspective. In this survey, we classify the literature and try to find common ground amongst different approaches with a view to application in robotics. We propose a categorisation based on the level of prior knowledge that is assumed to build the relationship among different affordance components that matter for a particular robotic task. We also identify areas for future improvement and discuss possible directions that are likely to be fruitful in terms of impact on robotics practice.},

Specifically, a new formulation of active inference which, unlike previous solutions, provides unbiased state estimation and simplifies the definition of probabilistically robust thresholds for fault-tolerant control of robotic systems using the free-energy. The proposed solution makes use of the sensory prediction errors in the free-energy for the generation of residuals and thresholds for fault detection and isolation of sensory faults, and it does not require additional controllers for fault recovery. Results validating the benefits in a simulated 2-DOF manipulator are presented, and future directions to improve the current fault recovery approach are discussed.},

  abstract = {Decades of research in control theory have shown that simple controllers, when provided with timely feedback, can control complex systems. Pushing is an example of a complex mechanical system that is difficult to model accurately due to unknown system parameters such as coefficients of friction and pressure distributions. In this paper, we explore the data-complexity required for controlling, rather than modeling, such a system. Results show that a model-based control approach, where the dynamical model is learned from data, is capable of performing complex pushing trajectories with a minimal amount of training data (10 data points). The dynamics of pushing interactions are modeled using a Gaussian process (GP) and are leveraged within a model predictive control approach that linearizes the GP and imposes actuator and task constraints for a planar manipulation task.},

It is based on optimistic techniques adapted from software transactional memory, but takes advantage of specific knowledge of the the algorithm to reduce overheads and avoid unnecessary retries. We extend our algorithm with a fast linearizable clone operation, which can be used for consistent iteration of the tree. Experimental evidence shows that our algorithm outperforms a highly tuned concurrent skip list for many access patterns, with an average of 39\% higher single-threaded throughput and 32\% higher multi-threaded throughput over a range of contention levels and operation mixes.},

This process of active interaction is in the same spirit as a scientist performing experiments to discover hidden facts. Recent advances in artificial intelligence have yielded machines that can achieve superhuman performance in Go, Atari, natural language processing, and complex control problems; however, it is not clear that these systems can rival the scientific intuition of even a young child. In this work we introduce a basic set of tasks that require agents to estimate properties such as mass and cohesion of objects in an interactive simulated environment where they can manipulate the objects and observe the consequences. We found that state of art deep reinforcement learning methods can learn to perform the experiments necessary to discover such hidden properties. By systematically manipulating the problem difficulty and the cost incurred by the agent for performing experiments, we found that agents learn different strategies that balance the cost of gathering information against the cost of making mistakes in different situations.},

Particularly, for complex manipulation tasks which are subject to geometric constraints, spatial information and a rich semantic knowledge about objects, types, and functionality are required, together with the way in which these objects can be manipulated. In this line, this paper presents an ontological-based reasoning framework called Perception and Manipulation Knowledge (PMK) that includes: (1) the modeling of the environment in a standardized way to provide common vocabularies for information exchange in human-robot or robot-robot collaboration, (2) a sensory module to perceive the objects in the environment and assert the ontological knowledge, (3) an evaluation-based analysis of the situation of the objects in the environment, in order to enhance the planning of manipulation tasks. The paper describes the concepts and the implementation of PMK, and presents an example demonstrating the range of information the framework can provide for autonomous robots.},

  abstract = {Motion planning problems encountered in manipulation and legged locomotion have a distinctive multi-modal structure, where the space of feasible configurations consists of intersecting submanifolds, often of different dimensionalities. Such a feasible space does not possess expansiveness, a property that characterizes whether planning queries can be solved efficiently with traditional probabilistic roadmap (PRM) planners. In this paper we present a new PRM-based multi-modal planning algorithm for problems where the number of intersecting manifolds is finite. We also analyze the completeness properties of this algorithm. More specifically, we show that the algorithm converges quickly when each submanifold is individually expansive and establish a bound on the expected running time in that case. We also present an incremental variant of the algorithm that has the same convergence properties, but works better for problems with a large number of submanifolds by considering subsets of submanifolds likely to contain a solution path. These algorithms are demonstrated in geometric examples and in a legged locomotion planner.},

  abstract = {Robots that perform complex manipulation tasks must be able to generate strategies that make and break contact with the object. This requires reasoning in a motion space with a particular multi-modal structure, in which the state contains both a discrete mode (the contact state) and a continuous configuration (the robot and object poses). In this paper we address multi-modal motion planning in the common setting where the state is high-dimensional, and there are a continuous infinity of modes. We present a highly general algorithm, Random-MMP, that repeatedly attempts mode switches sampled at random. A major theoretical result is that Random-MMP is formally reliable and scalable, and its running time depends on certain properties of the multi-modal structure of the problem that are not explicitly dependent on dimensionality. We apply the planner to a manipulation task on the Honda humanoid robot, where the robot is asked to push an object to a desired location on a cluttered table, and the robot is restricted to switch between walking, reaching, and pushing modes. Experiments in simulation and on the real robot demonstrate that Random-MMP solves problem instances that require several carefully chosen pushes in minutes on a PC.},

  abstract = {A new theory is taking hold in neuroscience. It is the theory that the brain is essentially a hypothesis-testing mechanism, one that attempts to minimise the error of its predictions about the sensory input it receives from the world. It is an attractive theory because powerful theoretical arguments support it, and yet it is at heart stunningly simple. Jakob Hohwy explains and explores this theory from the perspective of cognitive science and philosophy. The key argument throughout The Predictive Mind is that the mechanism explains the rich, deep, and multifaceted character of our conscious perception. It also gives a unified account of how perception is sculpted by attention, and how it depends on action. The mind is revealed as having a fragile and indirect relation to the world. Though we are deeply in tune with the world we are also strangely distanced from it. The first part of the book sets out how the theory enables rich, layered perception. The theory's probabilistic and statistical foundations are explained using examples from empirical research and analogies to different forms of inference. The second part uses the simple mechanism in an explanation of problematic cases of how we manage to represent, and sometimes misrepresent, the world in health as well as in mental illness. The third part looks into the mind, and shows how the theory accounts for attention, conscious unity, introspection, self and the privacy of our mental world. --},

  abstract = {During the last decade, sampling-based path planning algorithms, such as probabilistic roadmaps (PRM) and rapidly exploring random trees (RRT), have been shown to work well in practice and possess theoretical guarantees such as probabilistic completeness. However, little effort has been devoted to the formal analysis of the quality of the solution returned by such algorithms, e.g. as a function of the number of samples. The purpose of this paper is to fill this gap, by rigorously analyzing the asymptotic behavior of the cost of the solution returned by stochastic sampling-based algorithms as the number of samples increases. A number of negative results are provided, characterizing existing algorithms, e.g. showing that, under mild technical conditions, the cost of the solution returned by broadly used sampling-based algorithms converges almost surely to a non-optimal value. The main contribution of the paper is the introduction of new algorithms, namely, PRM* and RRT* , which are provably asymptotically optimal, i.e. such that the cost of the returned solution converges almost surely to the optimum. Moreover, it is shown that the computational complexity of the new algorithms is within a constant factor of that of their probabilistically complete (but not asymptotically optimal) counterparts. The analysis in this paper hinges on novel connections between stochastic sampling-based path planning algorithms and the theory of random geometric graphs.},

  abstract = {Robots with many degrees of freedom (e.g., humanoid robots and mobile manipulators) have increasingly been employed to accomplish realistic tasks in domains such as disaster relief, spacecraft logistics, and home caretaking. Finding feasible motions for these robots autonomously is essential for their operation. Sampling-based motion planning algorithms are effective for these high-dimensional systems; however, incorporating task constraints (e.g., keeping a cup level or writing on a board) into the planning process introduces significant challenges. This survey describes the families of methods for sampling-based planning with constraints and places them on a spectrum delineated by their complexity. Constrained sampling-based methods are based on two core primitive operations: ( a) sampling constraint-satisfying configurations and ( b) generating constraint-satisfying continuous motion. Although this article presents the basics of sampling-based planning for contextual background, it focuses on the representation of constraints and sampling-based planners that incorporate constraints.},

  abstract = {We consider the problem of constructing abstract representations for planning in high-dimensional, continuous environments. We assume an agent equipped with a collection of high-level actions, and construct representations provably capable of evaluating plans composed of sequences of those actions.  We first consider the deterministic planning case, and  show that the relevant computation involves set operations performed over sets of states. We define the specific collection of sets that is necessary and sufficient for planning, and use them to construct a  grounded abstract symbolic representation that is provably suitable for deterministic planning. The resulting representation can be expressed in PDDL, a canonical high-level planning domain language; we construct such a representation for the Playroom domain and solve it in milliseconds using an off-the-shelf planner.  We then consider probabilistic planning, which we show requires generalizing from sets of states to distributions over states. We identify the specific distributions required for planning, and use them to construct a grounded abstract symbolic representation that correctly estimates the expected reward and probability of success of any plan. In addition, we show that learning the relevant probability distributions corresponds to specific instances of probabilistic density estimation and probabilistic classification. We construct an agent that autonomously learns the correct abstract representation of a computer game domain, and rapidly solves it.   Finally, we apply these techniques to create a physical robot system that autonomously learns its own symbolic representation of a mobile manipulation task directly from sensorimotor data---point clouds, map locations, and joint angles---and then plans using that representation. Together, these results establish a principled link between high-level actions and abstract representations, a concrete theoretical foundation for constructing abstract representations with provable properties, and a practical mechanism for autonomously learning abstract high-level representations.},

  abstract = {This literature review addresses the use of Active inference in combination with ontological reasoning to obtain task planning capable of compensating controller failure in the presence of redundancy. This redundancy is in the form of actuators with overlapping functionality, satisfying similar task goals. The state-of-the-art for Active inference in robotics on task planning and control is reported, as a starting point for identifying strengths and drawbacks of this principle. A sufficiently detailed mathematical explanation of Active inference is de- scribed, to obtain insights on perception, action planning, and on parameters of this principle that could be exploited for improved action selection. After analyzing the current solutions in terms of computational expense, fault recovery and planning capabilities, a task planning framework using Active inference is identified. This framework excels from other current solutions in that it can provide context-free reactive action planning, takes into account pre- and postconditions and does not suffer from the curse of dimensionality. However alternative actions satisfying the same goals are chosen in a fixed order, which could lead to sub-optimal actions being chosen. More intelligent planning behavior requires the presence of situational knowledge in the decision making process. For situational knowledge to be generated and understood in a dynamic and human centered environment, capabilities necessary for au- tonomous behavior are identified. These capabilities are provided by ontological reasoning frameworks, whose aim is to achieve autonomous robotic systems. The state-of-the-art for ontological reasoning frameworks is reported, and discussed with re- spect to capabilities specifying autonomous behavior. Furthermore, a novel identification and characterization of fault recovery capabilities provided by these frameworks are listed, which could contribute to achieving fault recovery behavior during task planning. An onto- logical reasoning framework most suitable for providing situational knowledge is identified. A novel integration of ontological reasoning and the identified task planning framework using Active inference is proposed. This combination, exploiting the use of a parameter specifying the preferences over policies in Active inference, is hypothesised to improve action selection through Active inference by providing situational knowledge. This allows for more informed decision making leading to fault recovery behavior. The future goals are identified including testing this hypothesis through implementation on a robot manipulator in a physical retail environment.},

  abstract = {We address the problem of applying Task and Motion Planning (TAMP) in real world environments. TAMP combines symbolic and geometric reasoning to produce sequential manipulation plans, typically specified as joint-space trajectories, which are valid only as long as the environment is static and perception and control are highly accurate. In case of any changes in the environment, slow re-planning is required. We propose a TAMP algorithm that optimizes over Cartesian frames defined relative to target objects. The resulting plan then remains valid even if the objects are moving and can be executed by reactive controllers that adapt to these changes in real time. We apply our TAMP framework to a torque-controlled robot in a pick and place setting and demonstrate its ability to adapt to changing environments, inaccurate perception, and imprecise control, both in simulation and the real world.},

  abstract = {SUMMARY             Model predictive control (MPC) theory has gained attention with the recent increase in the processing power of computers that are now able to perform the needed calculations for this technique. This kind of control algorithms can achieve better results in trajectory tracking control of mobile robots than classical control approaches. In this paper, we present a review of recent developments in trajectory tracking control of mobile robot systems using model predictive control theory, especially when nonholonomicity is present. Furthermore, we point out the growth of the related research starting with the boom of mobile robotics in the 90s and discuss reported field applications of the described control problem. The objective of this paper is to provide a unified and accessible presentation, placing the classical model, problem formulations and approaches into a proper context and to become a starting point for researchers who are initiating their endeavors in linear/nonlinear MPC applied to nonholonomic mobile robots. Finally, this work aims to present a comprehensive review of the recent breakthroughs in the field, providing links to the most interesting and successful works, including our contributions to state-of-the-art.},

In contrast, decision making is an inherently discrete process, involving the selection among alternative courses of action. In this article, we consider the interface between the discrete and continuous processes that translate our decisions into movement in a Newtonian world—and how movement informs our decisions. We do so by appealing to active inference, with a special focus on the oculomotor system. Within this exemplar system, we argue that the superior colliculus is well placed to act as a discrete-continuous interface. Interestingly, when the neuronal computations within the superior colliculus are formulated in terms of active inference, we find that many aspects of its neuroanatomy emerge from the computations it must perform in this role.},

  abstract = {We propose a hybrid combination of active inference and behavior trees (BTs) for reactive action planning and execution in dynamic environments, showing how robotic tasks can be formulated as a free-energy minimization problem. The proposed approach allows to handle partially observable initial states and improves the robustness of classical BTs against unexpected contingencies while at the same time reducing the number of nodes in a tree. In this work, the general nominal behavior is specified offline through BTs, where a new type of leaf node, the prior node, is introduced to specify the desired state to be achieved rather than an action to be executed as typically done in BTs. The decision of which action to execute to reach the desired state is performed online through active inference. This results in the combination of continual online planning and hierarchical deliberation, that is an agent is able to follow a predefined offline plan while still being able to locally adapt and take autonomous decisions at runtime. The properties of our algorithm, such as convergence and robustness, are thoroughly analyzed, and the theoretical results are validated in two different mobile manipulators performing similar tasks, both in a simulated and real retail environment.},

  abstract = {Direct methods for trajectory optimization are widely used for planning locally optimal trajectories of robotic systems. Many critical tasks, such as locomotion and manipulation, often involve impacting the ground or objects in the environment. Most state-of-the-art techniques treat the discontinuous dynamics that result from impacts as discrete modes and restrict the search for a complete path to a specified sequence through these modes. Here we present a novel method for trajectory planning of rigid-body systems that contact their environment through inelastic impacts and Coulomb friction. This method eliminates the requirement for a priori mode ordering. Motivated by the formulation of multi-contact dynamics as a Linear Complementarity Problem for forward simulation, the proposed algorithm poses the optimization problem as a Mathematical Program with Complementarity Constraints. We leverage Sequential Quadratic Programming to naturally resolve contact constraint forces while simultaneously optimizing a trajectory that satisfies the complementarity constraints. The method scales well to high-dimensional systems with large numbers of possible modes. We demonstrate the approach on four increasingly complex systems: rotating a pinned object with a finger, simple grasping and manipulation, planar walking with the Spring Flamingo robot, and high-speed bipedal running on the FastRunner platform.},

  abstract = {Machine learning has long since become a keystone technology, accelerating science and applications in a broad range of domains. Consequently, the notion of applying learning methods to a particular problem set has become an established and valuable modus operandi to advance a particular field. In this article we argue that such an approach does not straightforwardly extended to robotics -- or to embodied intelligence more generally: systems which engage in a purposeful exchange of energy and information with a physical environment. In particular, the purview of embodied intelligent agents extends significantly beyond the typical considerations of main-stream machine learning approaches, which typically (i) do not consider operation under conditions significantly different from those encountered during training; (ii) do not consider the often substantial, long-lasting and potentially safety-critical nature of interactions during learning and deployment; (iii) do not require ready adaptation to novel tasks while at the same time (iv) effectively and efficiently curating and extending their models of the world through targeted and deliberate actions. In reality, therefore, these limitations result in learning-based systems which suffer from many of the same operational shortcomings as more traditional, engineering-based approaches when deployed on a robot outside a well defined, and often narrow operating envelope. Contrary to viewing embodied intelligence as another application domain for machine learning, here we argue that it is in fact a key driver for the advancement of machine learning technology. In this article our goal is to highlight challenges and opportunities that are specific to embodied intelligence and to propose research directions which may significantly advance the state-of-the-art in robot learning.},

  abstract = {Assistive robots designed for physical interaction with objects will play an important role in assisting with mobility and fall prevention in healthcare facilities. Autonomous mobile manipulation presents a hurdle prior to safely using robots in real-life applications. In this article, we introduce a mobile manipulation framework based on model predictive control using learned dynamics models of objects. We focus on the specific problem of manipulating legged objects such as those commonly found in healthcare environments and personal dwellings (e.g., walkers, tables, chairs). We describe a probabilistic method for autonomous learning of an approximate dynamics model for these objects. In this method, we learn dynamic parameters using a small dataset consisting of force and motion data from interactions between the robot and object. Moreover, we account for multiple manipulation strategies by formulating manipulation planning as a mixed-integer convex optimization. The proposed framework considers the hybrid control system composed of (i) choosing which leg to grasp and (ii) control of continuous applied forces for manipulation. We formalize our algorithm based on model predictive control to compensate for modeling errors and find an optimal path to manipulate the object from one configuration to another. We present results for several objects with various wheel configurations. Simulation and physical experiments show that the obtained dynamics models are sufficiently accurate for safe and collision-free manipulation. When combined with the proposed manipulation planning algorithm, the robot successfully moves the object to the desired pose while avoiding any collision.},

  abstract = {This paper is focused on the optimal motion planning of redundant planar serial robots, by avoiding obstacles within its workspace. A synergy-based algorithm between convex optimization, disjunctive programming and receding horizon is proposed to the end of achieving advantages such as finding the global optimum solution and low computational time. For the purpose of the problem, different cost functions can be considered, including among others, transition time, energy usage or path length. In addition, kinematic and dynamic relations of the robots under study are expressed as constraints of the problem and since they are non-convex functions, they are approximated by convex constraints. The proposed algorithm is simulated for 3-DOF and 4-DOF redundant planar serial robots in the presence of static and dynamic obstacles using the CVX package in MATLAB and the Gurobi optimization package in the Qt Creator environment. Finally, the proposed approach is implemented on a real 4-DOF planar serial robot via the Gurobi optimization package using the C++ programming language. Results reveal that using a moving horizon is a proper and reliable method to be used for real-time purposes compared with other approaches suggested in the literature. The average computational time at each step is less than 0.3 seconds.},

However, there is now cross-pollination and increasing interest in both fields to benefit from the advances of the other. In the present paper, we review fundamental concepts of causal inference and relate them to crucial open problems of machine learning, including transfer and generalization, thereby assaying how causality can contribute to modern machine learning research. This also applies in the opposite direction: we note that most work in causality starts from the premise that the causal variables are given. A central problem for AI and causality is, thus, causal representation learning, the discovery of high-level causal variables from low-level observations. Finally, we delineate some implications of causality for machine learning and propose key research areas at the intersection of both communities.},

  abstract = {We present a highly effective approach for the calibration of vehicle models. The approach combines the output error technique of system identification theory and the convolution integral solutions of linear systems and stochastic calculus. Rather than calibrate the system differential equation directly for unknown parameters, we calibrate its first integral. This integrated prediction error minimization (IPEM) approach is advantageous because it requires only low-frequency observations of state, and produces unbiased parameter estimates that optimize simulation accuracy for the chosen time horizon. We address the calibration of models that describe both systematic and stochastic dynamics, such that uncertainties can be computed for model predictions. We resolve numerous implementation issues in the application of IPEM, such as the efficient linearization of the dynamics integral with respect to parameters, the treatment of uncertainty in initial conditions, and the formulation of stochastic measurements and measurement covariances. While the technique can be used for any dynamical system, we demonstrate its usefulness for the calibration of wheeled vehicle models used in control and estimation. Specifically we calibrate models of odometry, powertrain dynamics, and wheel slip as it affects body frame velocity. Experimental results are provided for a variety of indoor and outdoor platforms.},

  abstract = {The active inference framework, and in particular its recent formulation as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), has gained increasing popularity in recent years as a useful approach for modelling neurocognitive processes. This framework is highly general and flexible in its ability to be customized to model any cognitive process, as well as simulate predicted neuronal responses based on its accompanying neural process theory. It also affords both simulation experiments for proof of principle and behavioral modelling for empirical studies. However, there are limited resources that explain how to build and run these models in practice, which limits their widespread use. Most introductions assume a technical background in programming, mathematics, and machine learning. In this paper we offer a step-by-step tutorial on how to build POMDPs, run simulations using standard MATLAB routines, and fit these models to empirical data. We assume a minimal background in programming and mathematics, thoroughly explain all equations, and provide exemplar scripts that can be customized for both theoretical and empirical studies. Our goal is to provide the reader with the requisite background knowledge and practical tools to apply active inference to their own research. We also provide optional technical sections and several appendices, which offer the interested reader additional technical details. This tutorial should provide the reader with all the tools necessary to use these models and to follow emerging advances in active inference research.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a data-efficient approach to learning transferable forward models for robotic push manipulation. Our approach extends our previous work on contact-based predictors by leveraging information on the pushed object's local surface features. We test the hypothesis that, by conditioning predictions on local surface features, we can achieve generalisation across objects of different shapes. In doing so, we do not require a CAD model of the object but rather rely on a point cloud object model (PCOM). Our approach involves learning motion models that are specific to contact models. Contact models encode the contacts seen during training time and allow generating similar contacts at prediction time. Predicting on familiar ground reduces the motion models' sample complexity while using local contact information for prediction increases their transferability. In extensive experiments in simulation, our approach is capable of transfer learning for various test objects, outperforming a baseline predictor. We support those results with a proof of concept on a real robot.},

With this regard, pushing is an essential motion primitive that dramatically extends a robot's manipulation repertoire. In this work, we review the robotic pushing literature. While focusing on work concerned with predicting the motion of pushed objects, we also cover relevant applications of pushing for planning and control. Beginning with analytical approaches, under which we also subsume physics engines, we then proceed to discuss work on learning models from data. In doing so, we dedicate a separate section to deep learning approaches which have seen a recent upsurge in the literature.

Even though the concept of PID tuning is simple, the mathematics underpinning PID control is complex. Once you have chosen the optimal controller configuration for your problem, the parameters must be tuned. Achieving optimal performance entails selecting the ideal set of numerical values for P, I and D. In broad terms, there are three PID tuning methods for determining the optimal combination of these settings: heuristic tuning, rule-based tuning, and model-based tuning. Each method has its pros and cons. Although many might believe that heuristic and rule-based PID tuning methods easy are free, they often turn out to be extremely time consuming and expensive. An overview of PID tuning methods is given below.},

However, a gap between such planning formulations and control methods for reactive execution remains. In this paper we propose a model predictive control approach dedicated to robustly execute a single sequence of constraints, which corresponds to a discrete decision sequence of a TAMP plan. We decompose the overall control problem into three sub-problems (solving for sequential waypoints, their timing, and a short receding horizon path) that each is a non-linear program solved online in each MPC cycle. The resulting control strategy can account for long-term interdependencies of constraints and reactively plan for a timing-optimal transition through all constraints. We additionally propose phase backtracking when running constraints are missed, leading to a fluent re-initiation behavior that is robust to perturbations and interferences by an experimenter.},

  abstract = {Contemporary approaches to perception, planning, estimation, and control have allowed robots to operate robustly as our remote surrogates in uncertain, unstructured environments. This progress now creates an opportunity for robots to operate not only in isolation, but also with and alongside humans in our complex environments. Realizing this opportunity requires an efficient and flexible medium through which humans can communicate with collaborative robots. Natural language provides one such medium, and through significant progress in statistical methods for natural-language understanding, robots are now able to interpret a diverse array of free-form commands. However, most contemporary approaches require a detailed, prior spatial-semantic map of the robot's environment that models the space of possible referents of an utterance. Consequently, these methods fail when robots are deployed in new, previously unknown, or partially-observed environments, particularly when mental models of the environment differ between the human operator and the robot. This paper provides a comprehensive description of a novel learning framework that allows field and service robots to interpret and correctly execute natural-language instructions in a priori unknown, unstructured environments. Integral to our approach is its use of language as a "sensor" -- inferring spatial, topological, and semantic information implicit in the utterance and then exploiting this information to learn a distribution over a latent environment model. We incorporate this distribution in a probabilistic, language grounding model and infer a distribution over a symbolic representation of the robot's action space. We use imitation learning to identify a belief-space policy that reasons over the environment and behavior distributions. We evaluate our framework through a variety navigation and mobile-manipulation experiments.},

The proposed method utilizes a physics engine, where the robot seeks to identify the inertial and friction parameters of the object by simulating its motion under different values of the parameters and identifying those that result in a simulation which matches the observed real motions. The problem is solved in a Bayesian optimization framework. The same framework is used for both identifying the model of an object online and searching for a policy that would minimize a given cost function according to the identified model. Experimental results both in simulation and using a real robot indicate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art model-free reinforcement learning approaches.},
