\chapter{Planning in Four Subspaces}%
\label{chap:proposed_planning}
\textit{Finding a path between the start- and target configuration whilst avoiding collisions with an existing \ac{RRT*} path planner~\cite{chen_fast_2018} was presented at the end of the previous chapter. This chapter extends that existing path planner's configuration space from free- and obstacle space to also incorperate movable- and unknown space. Movable space originates from objects in the environment that are known to be movable, unknown space originates from objects for which it is unknown weither they are movable or unmovable. The planner avoids obstacle space, is incentivezed to plan only in free space but can pass through unknown or movable space. A direct path lies in free space only, a blocked path passes through unknown- or movable space. To free a blocked path and make it a direct path, the object that causes the unknown- or movable space should be moved out of the way.\bs}

The modified algorithm has four tuning parameters that can be tweaked; The \textit{step size} and \textit{search size} were discussed in \Cref{subsec:motion_planning}. The third and fourth tuning parameters are the \textit{UnknownSpaceCost} and \textit{MovableSpaceCost}, which are fixed costs for crossing through unknown or movable space. Crossing through is defined as one or more nodes in the path lying in that subspace. If a path does not contain a node in unknown space, \textit{UnknownSpaceCost} will be 0, equivalent to movable space and \textit{MovableSpaceCost}. These cost are added to the $\mathit{Cost_{path}}$, which is redefined as:\bs

\[\mathit{Cost_{path}} = \mathit{MovableSpaceCost} + \mathit{UnknownSpaceCost} + \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \mathit{Distance}(\gls{c}_i, \gls{c}_{i+1})\]

Where $\mathit{n} \geq 2$ configuration points make up the path starting at $\gls{c}_\mathit{start}$ and ending at $\gls{c}_\mathit{target}$.\bs

The \ac{RRT*} algorithm searches for a path with the lowest cost, by adding a penalty for crossing through unknown or movable space the path planner is incentivised to find the shortest path around objects but prefers moving an object over making a large detour. Tuning the additional fixed cost for a path crossing through movable or unknown space balances the robot's decision between the length of a detour the robot is willing to drive, compared to pushing an object to free the path. Removing an unknown object bears more uncertainty than a movable object, motivating a higher cost to remove an unknown object compared to an known object. The pseudocode from \Cref{pseudocode:proposed_rrt_star_all} is presented again, with changes due to the extension indicated with a red colour.\bs

The proposed algorithm prevents planning a path through blocking objects except when no other option is available or a large detour can be prevented. No performance tests have been conducted on the modified path planner, apart from visual inspection. \Cref{fig:mp_push_or_drive} clearly shows the effect of varying \textit{UnknownSpaceCosts}.

\section{Kinodynamic Planning}
A generated path for a non-holonomic robot, such as the boxer robot in \Cref{subfig:example_boxer_robot} should respect the non-holonomic constraints. To take dynamic constraints (e.g. non-holonomic constraints or constrains on the derivatives of the planned path) into account, a dynamic model should be incorperated. Respecting dynamic constraints during path planning is named \textit{kinodynamic planning}

\todo{eleborate on how to incoreperate a dynamic model (and that sampling is then a bit different)}










Now that the modified path planner is discussed, the proposed robotic framework is discussed. The proposed framework relies on the required background from previous chapter, and relies on the modified path planner from this chapter.\bs



% old manipulation section shit

% \subsection{Manipulation Planning}%
% \label{subsec:manipulation_planning}
% With a push, two objects are primarily involved, the pushed object and the robot. Generally, and in this thesis, the pushed object's configuration is more important than the robot's configuration. The robot is only a means to push the object toward the target configuration. At which final configuration the robot itself ends up is of lesser importance. As long as during the push, the robot does not collide with objects other than the pushed object, and constraints on the robot must be respected.\bs

% To plan a path that respects the constraints, \todo{Corrado: What does this mean? ->} the robot's configuration is generated for every newly added sample in the manipulation planning algorithm.

% \todo{Gijs For reachbailbpcheck, These lines just point out the name of the function again , there is no added information }
% The \textit{ReachabilityCheck()} (see \Cref{table:functions_for_proposed_rrt_star} and line 33 in \Cref{pseudocode:proposed_rrt_star}) generates the robot configuration to validate if a new sample is reachable from an existing sample. This additional configuration is stored to create only feasible paths that respect the applied constraints. When the stopping criteria are reached and the shortest path is found, the generated robot configurations are discarded. \Cref{fig:manipulation_plannig_local_planner} displays a visual example of the procedure.\bs
