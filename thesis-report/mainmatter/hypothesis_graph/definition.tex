\subsection{Definition}%
\label{subsec:h-graph_definition}%
Before defining the \ac{h-graph}, some definitions are provided on which the \ac{h-graph} depends. First, recall the \textbf{configuration} definition.\bs

Formally an \textbf{configuration}, $\gls{c}_{id}(k)$ is a tuple of $\left\langle \gls{x}(\gls{k}), \gls{y}(\gls{k}), \gls{theta}(\gls{k})\right\rangle$\\ where $\gls{x}, \gls{y} \in \mathbb{R}, \quad  \gls{theta} \in [0, 2\pi)$\bs

An object is represented as its shape and configuration\\Formally, a \textbf{object},  $\gls{obj}_{id} = \left\langle \gls{objectClass}, \mathit{shape} \right\rangle $\bs

Where \textit{id} is an identifier for the object, \gls{objectClass} the objects classification and $\mathit{shape}$ is linked to a 3D representation of the object.\bs

An object node represents an object in a certain configuration.\\Formally, a \textbf{objectNode}, $V^{\gls{obj}}_{id} =\left\langle \gls{obj}, \gls{c}(k), \textrm{status} \right\rangle $.\bs

Where \textit{id} is an identifier for the node, \gls{obj} an object, $\gls{c}(k)$ the configuration at time step $k$ and status indicates if the configuration is reachable for the object that both reside in the node, the status can be INITIALIZED or COMPLETED or UNFEASIBLE.\bs

An edge describes how a node transitions to another node in the \ac{h-graph}. Edges are split into three categories since they accomplish different goals. \textit{System identification edges} that have as a goal to collect \ac{IO} data and to generate a system model with that data, \textit{action edges} steer a system toward a target configuration and \textit{emtpy edges} connect nodes that contain different objects that could otherwise not be connected. The edges are formally defined as:\bs

A \textbf{identification edge}, \[\gls{edge}^\mathit{iden}_\mathit{id} = \left\langle \mathit{id_{from}}, \mathit{id_{to}}, \textrm{Identification Method}, \textrm{\ac{IO} data set}, \textrm{controller}, \textrm{system model}, \textrm{status} \right\rangle\]\bs

Where \textit{id} is an identifier for the edge, $\mathit{id_{from}}$ and $\mathit{id_{to}}$ indicating the node identifier where the edge points from and to, respectively.~identification method indicates the used method for system identification, the \textrm{\ac{IO} data set} contains the input sequences and the system's recorded output reponse, the controller contains the controller used for driving the robot during data collection and the status indicates the node's status thas is eleborated in datail in \Cref{tikz:status_identification_edge}.\bs

A \textbf{action edge}, \[\gls{edge}^\mathit{action}_\mathit{id} = \left\langle id_{from}, id_{to}, \textrm{verb}, \textrm{controller},\textrm{system model}, \textrm{path}, \textrm{status} \right\rangle\]\bs

Where \textit{id} is a identifier for the edge, $\mathit{id_{from}}$ and $\mathit{id_{to}}$ indicating the node identifier where the edge points from and to, respectively.~verb is an English verb describing the action the edge represents (in this thesis driving or pushing), the controller contains the control method used for driving the robot, system model is the dynamic system model used by the control method, path is a list of configurations and status indicates the node's status thas is eleborated in datail in \Cref{tikz:status_action_edge}.\bs

Connecting nodes with edges is eleborated upon in the upcoming section. Two nodes can only be connected if they both contain the same object. The empty edge main goal is to connect nodes that contain different object, to involve multiple objects in a single action sequence.\bs

A \textbf{empty edge}, \[\gls{edge}^\mathit{emtpy}_\mathit{id} = \left\langle id_{from}, id_{to}, \textrm{status} \right\rangle\]\bs

Where \textit{id} is and identifier for the edge, status for an emtpy edge can be INITIALIZED or FAILED.\bs

Now that the nodes and edges have been defined, the \ac{h-graph} can be defined.\bs

Formally, a \textbf{hypothesis graph}, $\gls{h-graph} = \left\langle \gls{nodesH}, \gls{edgesH} \right\rangle $
\\ Where \gls{nodesH} is a set of nodes and \gls{edgesH} a set of edges, defined as: $\gls{nodesH} = \{\gls{nodesH}^{\gls{obj}}_{i}\}$, \quad $\gls{edgesH} \in \{\gls{edge}_{(i,j)}| \gls{edgesH}_i, \gls{edgesH}_j \in \{\gls{nodesH}^{\gls{obj}} \}, i \neq j\}$.\bs

Most \ac{h-graph} components have been defined. The status of an identification or action edge remains undefined and requires further explanation.\bs

\subsection{Edge statusus}\label{subsec:edge_status}
The edges are split into two categories, identification edges and action edges. An identification edge sends an input sequence and records the system output. That \ac{IO} sequence and assumptions on the system are the basis for system identification, techniques on various system identification methods are discussed in \Cref{sec:sys_iden}. The goal is to create a dynamic model augmented with a corresponding controller that forms closed-loop stable control. The status of an identification edge can be visualized in the following \ac{FSM}.\bs

\end{table}

An identification edge corresponds to an action edge because its goal is to generate a system model to hand over its corresponding action edge. The system identification method is selected after the action edge is selected to yield a system model compatible with the controller that resides in the action edge. Two types of system models are generated: system models that describe the driving behaviour of the robot and system models that describe the robot's push behaviour and an object's.\bs

After initialization, an action edge starts propagating its status as indicated in \Cref{tikz:status_action_edge}. An action edge's eventual goal is to track a path. First, the existence of a path is estimated, a system model must be provided, and action planning must be performed. \bs

\paragraph{\ac{H-graph} Legend}
\Cref{tikz:status_action_edge} shows that many steps must successfully be completed before the edge can be executed.
Before executing edges, edges must be initialized, which is where the next section is dedicated to.\bs

The following figure presents an legend for the \ac{h-graph}s that will be presented in the next section.\bs
