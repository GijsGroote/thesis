\section{Hypothesis Graph}%
\label{sec:h-graph}
The \acf{h-graph} consists of a set of nodes and edges. The node corresponds to an object at a configuration in configuration space, and the edges correspond to actions. Overall, the \ac{h-graph} represents a search in the composite configuration space. A search in the composite configuration space itself is avoided because an edge only operates in a single mode of dynamics. As a result path estimation and path planning for the action that the edge represents occur in configuration space and not in composite space. The \ac{h-graph} is explicitly created for a task with a single start and a single target node for every subtask in the task. The \ac{h-algorithm} discussed in the upcoming section is responsible with connecting starting node to the corresponding target node. When the \ac{h-algorithm} halts, and the task is completed, the \ac{h-graph} is no longer required and is discarded.\bs

The upcoming subsection defines and discusses the \ac{h-graph} in \Cref{subsec:h-graph_definition}. The status of an edge is discussed in \Cref{subsec:edge_status}, the section then finalizes with a legend to read a \ac{h-graph}.\bs
