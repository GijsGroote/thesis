\section{Hypothesis Graph}%
\label{sec:h-graph}
The \acf{h-graph} consists of a set of nodes and edges. The node corresponds to an object at a configuration in configuration space, and the edges correspond to actions. Overall, the \ac{h-graph} represents a search in the composite configuration space. A search in the composite configuration space itself is avoided because an edge only operates in a single mode of dynamics. As a result path estimation and path planning for the action that the edge represents occur in configuration space and not in composite space. The \ac{h-graph} is explicitly created for a task with a single start and a single target node for every subtask in the task. The \ac{h-algorithm} discussed in the upcoming section is responsible with connecting starting node to the corresponding target node. When the \ac{h-algorithm} halts, and the task is completed, the \ac{h-graph} is no longer required and is discarded.\bs

The upcoming subsection defines and discusses the \ac{h-graph} in \Cref{subsec:h-graph_definition}. The status of an edge is discussed in \Cref{subsec:edge_status}, the section then finalizes with a legend to read a \ac{h-graph}.\bs

Task:   &  Tuple of objects and corresponding target configurations.\\[-0.3cm]
        & \[\textrm{task} = \gls{task} = \left\langle \gls{Obj}_{\mathit{task}}, C_{\mathit{targets}} \right\rangle\]\\[-0.3cm]
Subtask:& A single object and a single target configuration.\\[-0.3cm]
        & \[\textrm{subtask} = \gls{subtask}= \left\langle \mathit{obj}_{\mathit{subtask}}, \gls{c}_{\mathit{target}} \right\rangle\]\\[-0.3cm]
Object Class & Classification assigned to an object.\\[-0.3cm]
             & \[\gls{objectClass} = \textrm{Unknown}\vee \textrm{Obstacle}\vee \textrm{Movable}\]\\[-0.3cm]
Node:   & A node in the \acs{h-graph} represents an object in a configuration with node status that indicates if the \ac{h-algorithm} manages to place the object to that configuration.\\[-0.3cm]
        & \[\textrm{node} = \gls{node} = \left\langle \textrm{status}, \mathit{obj}, c \right\rangle\]\\[-0.3cm]
Node Status:& Status of a node indicates if a node is initialized, the \ac{h-algorithm} was able to bring the object to the configuration or whether the \ac{h-algorithm} fails to bring the object to its configuration.\\[-0.3cm]
            & \[\gls{nodeStatus} = \mathrm{Initialised} \vee \mathrm{Completed} \vee \mathrm{Failed} \]\\[-0.3cm]
  & elaborate information on the edge statuses can be found in \Cref{tikz:status_action_edge}.\\
Edge:   & Edge connecting a node to another node in the \acs{h-graph} or \ac{k-graph}.\\[-0.3cm]
        & \[\textrm{edge} = \gls{edge} = \left\langle \textrm{status}, id_{\mathit{from}}, id_{\mathit{to}}, \textrm{verb}, \textrm{controller},\textrm{dynamic model}, \textrm{path}\right\rangle\]\\[-0.3cm]
Edge Status:& Status of an edge,\\[-0.3cm]
            & \[\gls{edgeStatus} = \mathrm{Initialised} \vee \mathrm{Path Exists} \vee \mathrm{System Model}\] \[ \vee \mathrm{Path Planned} \vee \mathrm{Executing} \vee \mathrm{Completed} \vee \mathrm{Failed}\]\\[-0.3cm]
Non-Failed Status:& Node- or edge status other than FAILED.\\
Hypothesis:& Sequence of successive edges in the \ac{h-graph}, an idea to put an object at its target configuration. If executed and completed, a subtask is completed.\\[-0.3cm]
           & \[\textrm{hypothesis} = \gls{hypothesis} = \left[\ \gls{edge}_{1}, \gls{edge}_{2}, \gls{edge}_{3}, \dots \gls{edge}_{m} \right]\,  m>0\]\\[-0.3cm]
Hypothesis Algorithm:& Graph-based algorithm that searches for hypothesis in the \ac{h-graph} to complete subtasks, eventually completing a task.\\
Hypothesis Graph:& Collection of nodes and edges. For every subtask, a start and target node exist in the \ac{h-graph}, and the \ac{h-algorithm} searches for a path through nodes and edges to connect the start to the target node.\\[-0.3cm]
                 & \[\textrm{\ac{h-graph}} = \gls{h-graph} = \left\langle \gls{nodesH}, \gls{edgesH} \right\rangle \]\\[-0.3cm]
Knowledge Graph:& Collection of nodes and edges. The \ac{k-graph} acts as a knowledge base and can be queried for an action suggestion.\\[-0.3cm]
                & \[\textrm{\ac{k-graph}} = \gls{k-graph} = \left\langle \gls{nodesK}, \gls{edgesK} \right\rangle \]\\[-0.3cm]
