\section{Hypothesis Graph}%
\label{sec:hgraph}
The \acf{hgraph} consists of a set of nodes and edges. Where the node correspond to an object at a configuration, and the edges correspond to actions. As a whole the \ac{hgraph} represents a search in the composite configuration space. The \ac{halgorithm} creates and updates nodes and edges in the \ac{hgraph} and is discussed in \Cref{subsec:halgorithm}. A search in the composite configuration space is avoided because an edge only operates in a single mode of dynamics, in the scope of this thesis a driving mode or pushing mode. The \ac{hgraph} is created specifically for a task with a single start and a single target node for every subtask in the task. When the \ac{halgorithm} halts and the task is completed, the \ac{hgraph} is no longer needed and is discarded.\bs

In the upcoming section the \ac{hgraph} is defined and discussed in \Cref{subsec:hgraph_definition}. The \ac{halgorithm} is then discussed and in \Cref{subsec:halgorithm}, where an explanation is provided on how the \ac{halgorithm} searches for a solution in the composite configuration space. The section is concluded with an extensive example.\bs

This chapter has terminology that is conveniently grouped in the following table.

\begin{tabular}%
  {>{\raggedright\arraybackslash}p{0.23\textwidth}%
   >{\raggedright\arraybackslash}p{0.67\textwidth}}
Task:   &  Tuple of objects and target configurations.\\
        & $\text{task} = \gls{task} = \left\langle \gls{Obj}_{\mathit{task}}, C_{\mathit{targets}} \right\rangle$\\
Subtask:& A single object, and a single target configuration.\\
        & $\text{subtask} = \gls{subtask}= \left\langle \mathit{obj}_{\mathit{subtask}}, \gls{c}_{\mathit{target}} \right\rangle$\\
Object Class & Classification assigned to an object.\\
             & $\gls{objectClass} = \textrm{Unknown}\vee \textrm{Obstacle}\vee \textrm{Movable}$\\
Node Status:& Status of a node indicates if a node is initialized, the \ac{halgorithm} was able to bring the object to the configuration or whether the \ac{halgorithm} fails to bring the object to its configuration.\\
            & \[\gls{nodeStatus} = \mathrm{Initialised} \vee \mathrm{Completed} \vee \mathrm{Failed} \]\\
Node:   & A node in the \acs{hgraph}, represents an object in a configuration with reachability indicated with a node status.\\
        & $\textrm{node} = \gls{node} = \left\langle \textrm{status}, \mathit{obj}, c \right\rangle$\\
Edge Status:& Status of a edge,\\
            & \[\gls{edgeStatus} = \mathrm{Initialised} \vee \mathrm{Path Exists} \vee \mathrm{System Model} \vee \] \[\mathrm{Path Planned} \vee \mathrm{Executing} \vee \mathrm{Completed} \vee \mathrm{Failed}\]\\
  & elaborate information on the edge statuses can be found in \Cref{tikz:status_action_edge}.\\
Edge:   & Edge connecting a node to another node in the \acs{hgraph} or \ac{kgraph}.\\
        & $ \textrm{edge} = \gls{edge} = \left\langle \textrm{status}, id_{\mathit{from}}, id_{\mathit{to}}, \textrm{verb}, \textrm{controller},\textrm{dynamic model}, \textrm{path}\right\rangle$\\
Hypothesis:& Sequence of successive edges in the \ac{hgraph}, an idea to put a object at it's target configuration. If executed and successfully completed, a subtask is completed.\\
           & $ \textrm{hypothesis} = \gls{hypothesis} = \left[\ \gls{edge}_{1}, \gls{edge}_{2}, \gls{edge}_{3}, \dots \gls{edge}_{m} \right]\ $, \hspace{0.5cm} $m>0$\\
Hypothesis Algorithm:& Graph based algorithm that searches for hypothesis in the \ac{hgraph} to complete subtasks eventually completing a task.\\
Hypothesis Graph:& Collection of nodes and edges. For every subtask a start and target node exist in the \ac{hgraph}, the \ac{halgorithm} searches for a path through nodes and edges to connect start to target node.\\
        & $ \textrm{\ac{hgraph}} = \gls{hgraph} = \left\langle \gls{nodesH}, \gls{edgesH} \right\rangle $\\
Knowledge Graph:& Collection of nodes and edges.  The \ac{kgraph} acts as a knowledge base and can be queried for an action suggestion.\\
        & $ \textrm{\ac{kgraph}} = \gls{kgraph} = \left\langle \gls{nodesK}, \gls{edgesK} \right\rangle $\\
