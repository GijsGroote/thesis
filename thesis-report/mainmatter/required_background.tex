\chapter{Required Background}%
\label{chap:required_background}
\textit{This chapter presents the components on which the proposed framework relies. These components are system identification, control methods, planning and fault detection. System identification converts \ac{IO} data into a system model as described in \Cref{sec:sys_iden}. In the scope of this thesis, a system model is required by control methods to create stable control and track a reference signal. Control methods are presented in \Cref{sec:control_methods}. Path planning is a core component of the proposed framework and is responsible for finding a path in configuration space. Such a path acts as a reference signal for the controller. Path planning is split into path estimation in \Cref{subsec:path_estimation}, motion planning in \Cref{subsec:motion_planning} and manipulation planning in \Cref{subsec:manipulation_planning}.
An existing path planner is presented in this chapter. In the next chapter, the planner is extended such that it can detect objects that are blocking the path.
 Lastly, fault detection halts persisting faulty behaviour and will be elaborated upon in \Cref{sec:monitoring_metrics}.\bs}
