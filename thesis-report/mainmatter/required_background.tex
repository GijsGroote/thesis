\chapter{Required Background}%
\label{chap:required_background}
\textit{This chapter presents the components on which the proposed framework relies. These components are system identification, control methods and planning. System identification converts \ac{IO} data into a system model, \Cref{sec:sys_iden} presents a categorization of system models and describes the procedure on how to collect \ac{IO} data. In the scope of this thesis, a system model is required by control methods to create stable control and track a reference signal, discussed in \Cref{sec:control_methods}. Path planning is a core component of the proposed framework and is responsible for finding a path in configuration space. Such a path acts as a reference signal for the controller. Path planning is split into path estimation in \Cref{subsec:path_estimation} and path planning in \Cref{subsec:motion_planning}. An existing path planner~\cite{wang_affordancebased_2020} is extensively discussed, to then expand upon in \Cref{chap:proposed_planning}.\bs}
