\chapter{Required Background}%
\label{chap:required_background}
\textit{This chapter presents the components that the proposed framework relies upon, the required background. These components are: system identification, control methods, planning and finally fault detection. Every component plays a crucial role for the proposed framework and their performance influences the proposed frameworks overall performance. System identification is responsible for converting \ac{IO} data into a system model, \Cref{sec:sys_iden}. System is required by control methods in order to create stable control and to track a reference signal. Control methods are presented in \Cref{sec:control_methods}. Planning is a core component of the proposed framework and is responsible for finding a path in configuration space. Such a path acts as reference signal for the controller and planning detects objects that are blocking the path, and must be removed first. The planning component is split into path estimation in \Cref{subsec:path_estimation}, motion planning in \Cref{subsec:motion_planning} and manipulation planning in \Cref{subsec:manipulation_planning}. Lastly fault detection halts persisting faulty behavior and will be elaborated upon in \Cref{sec:monitoring_metrics}.\bs}
