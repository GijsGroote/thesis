\section{Knowledge Graph}%
\label{sec:kgraph}
The \ac{hgraph}, discussed in the previous section, spans a lifetime over a single task. Learned system models created for future tasks are not stored for \ac{hgraph}. Storing learned environment knowledge is the \ac{kgraph}'s responsibility. Another responsibility of the \ac{kgraph} is to make an ordering in the stored environment knowledge. The ordering is made with a proposed success factor. This metric combines multiple metrics such as prediction error, tracking error and the success-fail ratio of an edge parameterization (controller and system model).\bs

The name \quotes{\acl{kgraph}} originates from the environmental knowledge it contains and its graph structure. Both the \ac{hgraph} and \ac{kgraph} are newly proposed frameworks built from the ground up, with only inspiration from an already existing technique, a backward search. The \ac{kgraph} does not adhere to any standard that may apply to standardized knowledge bases.\bs

The \ac{kgraph} fulfils two goals. It stores information on whether an object can be manipulated and stores edge parameterizations from the highest success factor to the lowest success factor per object. Information if objects can be manipulated to prevent the \ac{halgorithm} from trying to push unmovable objects.\bs
