Recall the \hyperref[researchquestion:main]{main research question}. \vspace{0.5\baselineskip}\\

\noindent Before answering the main research question, the two research subquestions are answered.\vspace{\baselineskip}

\noindent Recall \hyperref[researchsubquestion:does_it_work]{first research subquestion}:\vspace{0.5\baselineskip}\\
\textit{\indent\quotes{How does backtracing \cite{krontiris_dealing_2015} while remembering interactions with unknown obstacles compare to\\\indent not remembering learning interactions over time?}}\vspace{0.5\baselineskip}

\noindent The backwards search technique used by the hypothsis graph has shown to succesfully handle uncertain action sequences toward a task completion. Replanning occurs when edges fail to complete. To obtain a clear overview of the effect of learned system model, the effectiveness of the hgraph has been monitored over time in various metrics. Two cases have researched, task execution whilst remebering interaction in the knowledge graph versus task execution without a knowledge graph. The main difference was the time difference because system identification procedure was executed for every edge in the no KGraph case. Another difference was spotted, over time the KGraph case generates hypothesises which completed more often compared to the no KGraph case. \vspace{\baselineskip}


\noindent Recall the \hyperref[researchsubquestion:does_it_compare]{second research subquestion}:\vspace{0.5\baselineskip}\\
\textit{\quotes{Can the proposed method combine learning and planning for push en drive applications? Can the proposed method complete tasks, and how does it compare against the state of the art?}}\vspace{0.5\baselineskip}

The proposed hypothesis graph with assiciated knowledge graph was able to perform as good or better compared to teh state of the art. The proposed method was tested agains existing methods which only a subset of tasks, or 2 of the 3 topics. In comparinson with with\cite{sabbaghnovin_model_2021} the proposed method was shown to perform similar in prediction errors, final displacement error. The proposed method is not designed to optimise a global plan, thus unnessecary driving and pushing can occur.

Now the main question can be answered...


\section{Drawbacks}
\cite{vega-brown_asymptotically_2020} optimises a global path (let's say shortest path to complete a task), the proposed method takes a random subtask which does not even try to converte toward a global optimal path.
