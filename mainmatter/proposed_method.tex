\chapter{The Hypothesis and Knowledge graph}
\textit{
As defined in the introduction, a task consists of obstacles with corresponding target positions, an obstacle with an accompanying target position is called a subtask. The \textbf{hypothesis graph} contains nodes corresponding to obstacles at a certain position and edges corresponding to actions which relocate obstacles, and connect nodes in the hypothesis graph. A formal description of the hypothesis graph with its nodes and edges is given in \cref{subsec: hgraph_definition} and \cref{subsec: sys_iden_and_control_methods} elaborates the meaning of actions taken when traversing over one of the hypothesis graphs edges.\\
\newline
For every subtask in a task, a start and a target node is created, the hypothesis graph tries to connect the starting node to the corresponding target node by adding nodes and edges. The choice and content of these nodes and edges is based on local planning and randomisation, elaborated in \cref{subsec: estimating_path_existence,subsec: motion_planning,subsec: manipulation_planning}. A successive path from a starting node to the corresponding target node is called a hypothesis. During the search for a hypothesis, the hypothesis graph resides in the \textbf{search loop}, when traversing over edges toward the target node the hypothesis graph resides in the \textbf{execution loop}, both loops are elaborated in \cref{subsec: 2_loops}. When the hypothesis graph traverses over an edge, fault detectors monitors the progress, elaborated in \cref{subsec: fault_detection}. Finally an example of an hypothesis graph is given in \cref{subsec: hgraph_example}.\\
\newline
After execution, the traversed edge enters a review period, during which performance is checked in various metrics. The review is stored in a database, called the \textbf{knowledge graph} which serves to collect edges and rank them based on performance. The knowledge graph is defined in \cref{subsec: kgraph_definition}, metrics to rank edges can be found in \cref{subsec: edge_metrics} and an example is displayed in \cref{subsec: kgraph_example}.
