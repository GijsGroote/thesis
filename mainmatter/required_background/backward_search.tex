% The planning problem arises when a path from the start to the target configuration for an object must be found. Such a path cannot cross through obstacle space and must be feasible for the system to track. Motion and manipulation planning are split up because there are some major differences. Motion planning only plans for the robot whilst manipulation planning plans for the robot and some objects. Manipulation planning bears more constraints than motion planning because constraints for the robot, the obstacle and constraints between the robot and the obstacle must be respected. A system model discussed in \cref{subsec:sys_iden} acts as a local planner and validates if a path is feasible.
