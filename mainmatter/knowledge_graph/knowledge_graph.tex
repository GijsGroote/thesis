\section{Knowledge Graph}%
\label{sec:kgraph}
The \ac{hgraph} discussed in previous section has a lifetime that spans over a single task, learned system models are not stored for \ac{hgraph} that are created for future tasks. Storing learned environment knowledge is the \ac{kgraph}'s responsibility. Another responsibility of the \ac{kgraph} is to make an ordering in the stored environment knowledge. The ordering is made with a proposed success factor, a metric that combines multiple metrics such as prediction error, tracking error and the success-fail ratio of a edge parameterisation (controller and system model).
