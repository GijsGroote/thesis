\section{Hypothesis Graph}%
\label{sec:hgraph}
The \ac{hgraph} is responsible for generating action sequences, called hypothesis (consisting of a list of successive edges from start to target node in the \ac{hgraph}) that complete a single subtask. When all subtasks in a task are completed, the \ac{hgraph} halts and concludes the task successfully completed. A search in the joint configuration space is avoided because an edge only operates in a single mode of dynamics, such as driving or pushing. When an object cannot directly be steered toward its target location new nodes are generated which need to be completed before the original object can be steered toward its target location. An example of when an object cannot directly be steered toward its target state is because the path is blocked by another object. A hypothesis, consisting of a list of edges that represent actions in the robot environment might succeed or fail. \Cref{tikz:flowchart_hgraph} displays a flowchart explaining how new nodes and edges are generated in the \ac{hgraph}. Succesfully completed edges eventually result in completed subtasks, failed edges trigger replanning that will restart the search to a hypothesis.\bs

\Cref{subsec:hgraph_definition} defines the \ac{hgraph} and components, then~\cref{subsec:two_loops} eleborates how the \ac{hgraph} searches for a solution in the joint configuration space. The section is concluded with an extensive example.\bs
