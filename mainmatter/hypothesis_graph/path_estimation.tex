Graph-based planning

\quotes{The main idea is to discretise the configuration space with a finite discretisation. The emerged cells act as nodes in the graph, cells are connected through edges to nearby cells. Graph-based planners start from the cell containing the starting pose and search for the cell containing the target pose whills avoiding cells which lie in obstacle space.}
